# SMBBrowser

## Description
This project aims to investigate the feasibility of connecting to local network computers that offer file sharing options using the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. To conduct a thorough analysis, the POC will be executed in a non-sandboxed environment, enabling the extensive use of privacy-related network queries.

## Usage
When you run this project, it will list all the available SMB computers on the local network. If you select any one of them from the list, it will prompt you to enter a username and password. Once you provide the correct credentials, it will list the available public folders. You can then choose any one of these folders, and it will be mounted. You can check the mounted folder in Finder under the Network section.
